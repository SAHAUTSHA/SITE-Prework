## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

The only external resource I had used was a website called “coolors,” which provides an array of color pallets. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 





** 3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? 

After completing this submission, I have many topics and questions about web development. My first one would be how would smooth animations be inserted or created? Another question would be how a backend would be connected to our submission. A backend would be allowed to assign each different user a special playerID, and that playerID could be assigned their unique number of points (dependent on the player's success). I also am interested in how to create a website that can take input from a user. For example, many websites have a place where users can 'leave a message,' taking in name, email, and inquiry. Another question I have for web development is how much Apache is necessary to know. Does a Web developer need to be fully skilled in Apache? I also wanted to know how someone would go to create an e-commerce website from scratch? Another question I would have is more about loading times. How could I reduce page loading times if I want to create a website that almost automatically loads within seconds? 

** 4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
